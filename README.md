This project aims to implement a robust student card recognition system utilizing Python programming language and YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once version 4) object detection algorithm. The primary objective is to develop a solution that can accurately detect and determine whether a student is carrying a valid student identification card.

The YOLOv4 algorithm, renowned for its efficiency in real-time object detection, will be employed to precisely identify and localize student cards within images or video frames. The implementation in Python ensures a flexible and widely supported environment for seamless integration and further development.

The student card recognition system functions by analyzing input images or video streams to ascertain the presence or absence of a student identification card. The YOLOv4 model, trained on relevant datasets, plays a pivotal role in accurately recognizing and delineating the student cards. The system is designed to provide real-time responses, making it suitable for applications such as attendance tracking, access control, or security monitoring.

The detailed documentation accompanying the project will offer comprehensive insights into the development process, including the installation and configuration of the YOLOv4 model, integration with Python, and the step-by-step implementation of the student card recognition system. It will cover the training data, model training procedure, and fine-tuning process for optimal performance. Additionally, the documentation will provide guidelines on how to deploy and utilize the system effectively.
